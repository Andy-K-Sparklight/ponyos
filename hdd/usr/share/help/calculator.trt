A simple four-function calculator.

<h2>Technical Details</h2>

The calculator uses Python's integrated parsing and AST to format mathematical expressions. As such, some functions are different from a normal calculator. For example, you can use <mono>**</mono> as an exponent operator, parenthesis do not imply multiplication (<mono>2(4)</mono> is a syntax error; use <mono>2*(4)</mono> or similar instead), etc.
